# Julia-Node-stack-demo

This is a very minimal example of a node website that uses a julia backend to perform some calculation.  Upload a two-column csv and number of groups to run Clustering.jl's kmeans on it.  The results are logged to the javascript console because I haven't gotten around to having it do real output yet.

### Setting up

npm install 
node index.js


Make sure you have the Clustering.jl module.
